🔒 Catalyst Guardian Council Security System (GCSS) + Admin Guardian Council (AGC)

Catalyst is the first NFT-neutral staking and governance protocol to integrate the Guardian Council Security System (GCSS) for protecting the deployer role and the Admin Guardian Council (AGC) for protecting the default admin role.

Both councils use 7 guardians with a 5-of-7 approval threshold, combining:

Multi-party recovery – prevents single points of failure.

Compromise detection – 6/7 approvals raise a ⚠️ warning, 7/7 triggers 🚨 auto-lock.

Automatic safety locks – ensure contracts cannot be silently taken over.


This makes Catalyst not only a universal NFT utility protocol but also the first protocol secured by DRS (Decentralized Recovery System), setting a new standard for trust in upgradeable smart contracts.
