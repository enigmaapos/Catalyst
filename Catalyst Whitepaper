Catalyst Whitepaper (Updated Final Version)

Universal Utility & Governance for All NFTs


---

1. Introduction

The NFT space has rapidly evolved, but it remains fragmented. Blue-chip collections dominate the spotlight, while thousands of smaller or abandoned projects struggle for relevance. Holders of failed or ‚Äújunk‚Äù NFTs are left with no utility, no governance rights, and no pathway back into the ecosystem.

Catalyst changes this.

We are the first NFT-neutral staking and governance protocol, designed to give universal utility to every ERC-721 token ‚Äî whether blue-chip, indie, or abandoned.

Catalyst is not a marketplace, nor a speculative platform. Catalyst is an infrastructure layer: a deflationary staking protocol where all NFTs can earn, burn, and participate in governance ‚Äî with safeguards that protect credibility and sustainability.


---

2. Vision

> To become the universal utility layer of the NFT ecosystem, where every NFT has value and every collection can contribute to shaping the future of decentralized communities.




---

3. Mission

Empower Holders ‚Äì Give all NFT owners, from BAYC whales to rug-pull survivors, a way to extract real value.

Balance Incentives ‚Äì Reward credible collections while still including unverified ones through proof-of-burn mechanics.

Deflationary Tokenomics ‚Äì Make CATA a sustainable asset through continuous burn mechanics and dynamic fees.

Governance for All ‚Äì Create a governance model that scales with the ecosystem, balancing top collections with small contributors.

Bridge Legitimacy ‚Äì Increase blue-chip acceptance by filtering junk responsibly without excluding survivors.



---

4. Goals

Establish CATA as the core staking & governance token of NFT utility.

Build a dual-tier ecosystem:

Verified collections with full privileges.

Unverified collections that must burn and prove commitment before upgrading.


Maintain a deflationary balance between minted rewards and burned CATA.

Provide a transparent, community-driven governance model based on burns and stake-age.

Position Catalyst as the infrastructure standard for NFT staking, governance, and protocol neutrality.



---

5. Core Philosophy

1. NFT-Neutral Utility ‚Äì Every ERC-721 is unique on-chain, even if marketplaces call it ‚Äújunk.‚Äù


2. Proof-of-Burn Legitimacy ‚Äì Junk collections must burn extra CATA to join, aligning incentives and discouraging spam.


3. Adaptive Governance ‚Äì Voting eligibility is dynamic, scaling with ecosystem growth.


4. Transparency & Fairness ‚Äì Upgrades from Unverified ‚Üí Verified require meeting objective on-chain conditions and governance approval.


5. Deflationary Economics ‚Äì Registration fees, harvest burns, unstake burns, and bonus programs continuously destroy supply.




---

6. Tokenomics (CATA)

Token Name: Catalyst (CATA)
Type: ERC-20 Utility & Governance Token

Deflationary Mechanics

Harvest burn fee (dynamic % based on protocol load).

Unstake burn fee.

Collection registration fees.

Voluntary burns by users.


Emission Mechanics

Staking NFTs mints new CATA.

Base reward rate dynamically adjusts with participation.

Global staking capacity capped at 1,000,000,000 NFTs:

75% Term stake (750M NFTs)

25% Permanent stake (250M NFTs)



Immutable Fee Distribution

Every protocol fee follows the permanent rule:

90% Burned ‚Äì permanently reduces supply.

9% Treasury ‚Äì governance-controlled community pool.

1% Owner (Deployer) ‚Äì immutable share allocated to the protocol creator/maintainer.


Applies to all events: registration, unstake, harvest, and voluntary burns.

Treasury Usage

The Treasury‚Äôs 9% share is controlled by governance and may be used for:

Burner bonus distributions.

Future community-approved initiatives (grants, ecosystem support, integrations, audits).


Top 1% Burner Bonus

Every cycle (~weekly), the top 1% of wallets ranked by burned CATA receive a bonus from the Treasury.

Eligibility requires:

Minimum burn threshold.

Minimum staked NFTs.

Sybil-resistance (minimum burn per address).


The bonus pool is capped (default: 5% of Treasury per cycle).


---

7. Collection Tiers

Verified (Blue-Chip / Curated)

Normal dynamic registration fee (scaled with declared supply).

Full staking & governance rights.

Lower cost, higher legitimacy.


Unverified (Junk / Rug Survivors)

Base fee + surcharge escrow (refunded on upgrade, forfeited otherwise).

Reduced voting weight unless burn threshold is met.

Upgrade path: requires age, burn contribution, stakers, and governance approval.



---

8. Governance Model

Catalyst introduces Burn-Weighted Collection Governance (BWCG):

Top collections by burned CATA get full voting rights.

Smaller collections participate with fractional weight once burn thresholds are met.

Stake-age requirement prevents flash-stake manipulation.

Per-collection vote cap prevents whales from monopolizing votes.

Proposal lifecycle: Propose ‚Üí Vote ‚Üí Execute (after quorum & time window).


Governable Parameters

Base reward rate.

Voting rules.

Collection upgrades.

Treasury usage.

Bonus pool % allocation.


‚ö†Ô∏è Governance cannot change the 90/9/1 distribution rule.


---

9. Security, Scalability, Sustainability

Security: Built on audited OpenZeppelin libraries; reentrancy-protected; pausable; escrow mechanics protect against spam.

Scalability: Per-collection staking capped at 20,000 NFTs; global staking capped at 1 billion NFTs.

Sustainability: Immutable 90% burn, continuous deflation, and capped Treasury bonuses maintain long-term balance.



---

10. Competitive Edge

First protocol to give junk NFTs real utility.

Blue-chip credibility by filtering junk through burn-based proof and governance.

Adaptive governance that scales with ecosystem growth.

Top 1% Burner Bonus ‚Äì unique gamified incentive for holders.

Universal NFT utility layer ‚Äî Catalyst doesn‚Äôt replace marketplaces, it empowers them.



---

11. Roadmap

Phase 1: Core contract deployment (staking, burning, governance).
Phase 2: Frontend UI & community dashboard.
Phase 3: Governance bootstrapping; first upgrade votes.
Phase 4: Strategic integrations with NFT marketplaces & dApps.
Phase 5: Expansion of utility ‚Äî cross-chain staking, DeFi integrations, NFT collateralization.


---

12. Conclusion

Catalyst is not just another NFT staking dApp. It is the foundation of a new model:

A universal utility layer where every NFT, even ‚Äújunk,‚Äù has on-chain value.

A governance system where legitimacy is proven through burn and participation.

A deflationary economy designed for long-term sustainability.

A bonus system that rewards the most committed burners, strengthening the ecosystem further.


Catalyst is where NFT ecosystems converge ‚Äî blue-chip and junk alike ‚Äî into one unified, deflationary, community-governed protocol.


üìë Technical Appendix ‚Äî Catalyst Smart Contract Architecture

1. Overview

Catalyst is deployed as a modular, upgradeable protocol.
The design separates user-facing functions from business logic modules (libraries) to ensure security, scalability, and long-term governance alignment.

Upgradeable Core (CatalystNFTStakingCore): Manages state, ERC-20 mint/burn, NFT custody, and routes calls to libraries.

Libraries: Encapsulate staking, governance, fee management, config registry, proposal execution, and treasury functions.

Immutable Rules: The 90% burn, 9% treasury, 1% deployer distribution cannot be altered.


This architecture is fully aligned with Catalyst‚Äôs whitepaper principles of deflationary economics, NFT-neutral utility, and governance fairness.
