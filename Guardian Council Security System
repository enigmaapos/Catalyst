Guardian Council Security System

A Decentralized Recovery and Safety Layer for Catalyst Protocol

1. Introduction

In blockchain systems, private keys are everything. If the deployer‚Äôs wallet is lost or compromised, the whole protocol‚Äôs economics and fee flows can be at risk. Traditional single-owner control is too fragile, while full governance voting is too slow for emergency recovery.

The Guardian Council Security System provides a middle ground:

Fast recovery if the deployer loses access.

Multi-party protection against hacks.

Automatic compromise detection if too many guardians approve at once.

2. How It Works

At deployment, 5 guardian addresses are chosen. These are trusted wallets, ideally controlled by different parties or devices.

Deployer Address ‚Üí receives the deployer‚Äôs share of fees (1%).

Guardian Council (5) ‚Üí act as ‚Äúsafety guardians‚Äù who can help recover or rotate the deployer if needed.


A. Recovery Process

1. If the deployer loses access, any guardian can propose a new deployer address.


2. Other guardians then vote (approve) this proposal.


3. If 3 of 5 guardians approve within 3 days, the recovery can be executed:

The deployer role is transferred to the new address.

The old deployer (if listed as guardian) is automatically removed.





---

3. Compromise Detection

The system monitors the number of approvals:

3 approvals ‚Üí ‚úÖ Recovery valid, new deployer confirmed.

4 approvals ‚Üí ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Council may be partially compromised.

5 approvals ‚Üí üö® Critical: Likely full compromise.

In this case, the system automatically locks recovery to prevent attackers from seizing control.

4. Unlocking After Compromise

When recovery is locked (5/5 compromise), only the current valid deployer can reset the guardian set:

1. The deployer calls resetGuardians() with 5 new addresses.


2. This wipes the old guardian set and installs the new council.


3. Recovery is unlocked and returns to normal operation.



This ensures that only the true owner, who has control of the valid deployer address, can bring the system back after a suspected compromise.

5. Benefits

Resilient to key loss ‚Üí Deployers can recover access via guardians.

Hard to attack ‚Üí An attacker would need to compromise 3 of 5 guardians simultaneously.

Compromise warning ‚Üí 4/5 or 5/5 approvals act as early signals of suspicious activity.

Failsafe lock ‚Üí In case of full compromise, the system locks itself until the real owner resets guardians.

6. Best Practices

Guardians should be distributed across different people, devices, or even geographies.

Guardians should not all be stored on the same hardware or controlled by one individual.

Deployers should rotate guardians periodically to reduce long-term risk.



---

7. Summary

The Guardian Council is like a board of safety officers for the protocol.

It prevents catastrophic failure if one person loses keys.

It warns the community if suspicious voting patterns emerge.

It ensures that recovery power can never silently be hijacked by attackers.


This system combines the best of multisig security, voting governance, and automatic detection, giving Catalyst protocol a strong, simple, and transparent layer of protection.
