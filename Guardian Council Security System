Guardian Council Security System

A Decentralized Recovery and Safety Layer for Catalyst Protocol


---

1. Introduction

In blockchain systems, private keys are everything. If the deployer’s wallet is lost or compromised, the whole protocol’s economics and fee flows can be at risk. Traditional single-owner control is too fragile, while full governance voting is too slow for emergency recovery.

The Guardian Council Security System provides a middle ground:

Fast recovery if the deployer loses access.

Multi-party protection against hacks.

Automatic compromise detection if too many guardians approve at once.

Failsafe reset ability for the “last honest guardian” to prevent full compromise.



---

2. How It Works

At deployment, 5 guardian addresses are chosen. These are trusted wallets, ideally controlled by different parties or devices.

Deployer Address → receives the deployer’s share of fees (1%).

Guardian Council (5) → act as “safety guardians” who can help recover or rotate the deployer if needed.



---

A. Recovery Process

1. If the deployer loses access, any guardian can propose a new deployer address.


2. Other guardians then vote (approve) this proposal.


3. If 3 of 5 guardians approve within 3 days, the recovery can be executed:

The deployer role is transferred to the new address.

The old deployer (if listed as guardian) is automatically removed.





---

3. Compromise Detection

The system monitors the number of approvals:

3 approvals → ✅ Recovery valid, new deployer confirmed.

4 approvals → ⚠️ Warning: Council may be partially compromised.

5 approvals → 🚨 Critical: Likely full compromise.


At 5 approvals, the system automatically locks recovery to prevent attackers from seizing control.


---

4. Unlocking After Compromise

When recovery is locked (5/5 compromise), only the current valid deployer could previously reset the guardian set.

But now, the system includes a Last Honest Guardian Reset:

If 4 approvals exist, the only guardian who has not voted is flagged as the “last honest guardian.”

This guardian gains a 48-hour special power to reset the guardian set.

They can replace the 5 guardians with a fresh set, effectively breaking the attack before it reaches 5 approvals.

If they don’t act, the process continues and may lock at 5/5 approvals.


This ensures that even if 4 guardians are compromised, the 5th can still protect the protocol.


---

5. Benefits

Resilient to key loss → Deployers can recover access via guardians.

Hard to attack → An attacker must compromise at least 3 guardians, and in practice, almost all 5.

Compromise warning → 4/5 or 5/5 approvals act as early signals of suspicious activity.

Failsafe lock → In case of full compromise, the system locks itself until reset.

Last Honest Guardian Defense → Even under 4 compromised guardians, the final honest one can reset and restore safety.



---

6. Best Practices

Guardians should be distributed across different people, devices, or even geographies.

Guardians should not all be stored on the same hardware or controlled by one individual.

Deployers should rotate guardians periodically to reduce long-term risk.

The last guardian should be clearly informed of their responsibility in 4-approval scenarios.



---

7. Summary

The Guardian Council is like a board of safety officers for the protocol.

It prevents catastrophic failure if one person loses keys.

It warns the community if suspicious voting patterns emerge.

It ensures that recovery power can never silently be hijacked by attackers.

It now gives the last honest guardian the ability to reset the council, adding a final protective layer against coordinated compromise.


This system combines the best of multisig security, voting governance, automatic detection, and guardian-of-last-resort recovery, giving Catalyst protocol a strong, simple, and transparent layer of protection.



🔑 Projects Using Guardian Systems

1. Argent Wallet

One of the first smart contract wallets.

Uses “Guardians” (friends, hardware wallets, or trusted services) to:

Approve recoveries if the main wallet is lost.

Lock/unlock the wallet in emergencies.


Very similar to what we’re designing → 3-of-N guardian approvals.



2. Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe)

Multisig wallet widely used by DAOs.

Doesn’t call it “guardians,” but same principle: multiple owners/approvers.

Used by Uniswap, Aave, and many top DeFi projects.



3. ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction)

Adds native support for guardians/recovery logic in smart accounts.

Lets you set recovery policies like:

2-of-3 guardians can recover.

Time-locked recovery.

Social recovery flows.




4. zkSync Era & Starknet Wallets

Smart contract wallets on L2s (like Argent X, Braavos).

Use social recovery guardians.

Example: If your seed phrase is lost, guardians can reassign ownership.

🔒 Why Guardians?

Humans lose keys a lot (stats: ~20% of Bitcoin supply is lost forever).

Guardians solve this by introducing a social backup.

Instead of 1 person holding the “nuclear button,” trust is split across a group.



---

⚡ The difference with our design is:

Guardians are not just for recovery → they are tied to deployer role & treasury safety.

We even extend to “compromise detection” (4/5 votes = warning, 5/5 votes = lock).

Guardian concept	Yes (friends/devices as guardians)	Multisig owners, not called guardians	Yes, built-in recovery guardians	✅ Explicit “Guardian Council” of 5 fixed members
Threshold recovery	2-of-3 or configurable	Configurable multisig (e.g., 3-of-5)	Yes, flexible	✅ Fixed 3-of-5 approvals required
Deployer fee split link	❌ not applicable	❌ not applicable	❌ not tied to economics	✅ Guardians control recovery of deployer (who gets fee split)
Compromise detection	❌	❌	❌	✅ Special rules: 4-of-5 = warning, 5-of-5 = lock-down
Guardian rotation	Owner can add/remove guardians	Multisig owners can change members	Supported	✅ Automatic rotation after recovery (new deployer can add replacement)
Failsafe if all compromised	Owner only	Owners only	Recovery policies vary	✅ Recovery lock, only valid deployer can reset council
Upgrade security	No	Multisig approval required	Optional policies	(Optional) Can extend guardians to control upgrade approval
Transparency	Guardians known only to owner	All owners visible on-chain	Configurable	✅ Entire guardian set visible on-chain
Scope	Wallet recovery only	Treasury & governance via multisig	Wallet/account recovery	✅ Covers recovery, treasury safety, fee splits, and governance-like safety

⚡ Key Insights

✅ Advanced:

Your system adds compromise detection (4/5 warning, 5/5 lock), which no other guardian implementation has.

Guardians tied directly to economic roles (deployer fees + treasury safety).

Built-in rotation logic so the council always stays at 5 members.


✅ Unique:

Recovery affects the deployer address, not just wallet access.

Hybrid of multisig + social recovery, but with layered states (normal → warning → lock).


⚠️ Possible weaknesses:

More complex rules → higher risk of bugs if not carefully audited.

If guardians collude, they can still replace the deployer (though threshold mitigates it).

Requires careful choice of guardians (trustworthy, diverse, not easily compromised).

📌 Conclusion:
Your Guardian Council is more advanced than Argent and Safe in terms of security layers (compromise detection, auto-rotation, link to treasury/deployer). It’s not just a copy of existing systems — it’s a novel governance-security hybrid.
