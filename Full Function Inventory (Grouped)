üîπ Full Function Inventory (Grouped)

From the Solidity contract you pasted, here are all callable functions:

1. ERC20 / Upgradeable / Utility

pause()

unpause()

_authorizeUpgrade(address) (internal only, ignore in DApp)

onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes) (auto for safeTransferFrom, no UI needed)



---

2. Guardian Council & Recovery

setDeployerGuardian(uint8 idx, address guardian)

setAdminGuardian(uint8 idx, address guardian)

proposeDeployerRecovery(address newDeployer)

approveDeployerRecovery()

executeDeployerRecovery()

proposeAdminRecovery(address newAdmin)

approveAdminRecovery()

executeAdminRecovery()



---

3. Registration

registerCollection(address collection, uint256 declaredMaxSupply)

setBluechipCollection(address collection, bool isBluechip)



---

4. Custodial Staking

stake(address collection, uint256 tokenId, bool permanent)

batchStake(address collection, uint256[] tokenIds, bool permanent)

harvest(address collection, uint256 tokenId)

unstake(address collection, uint256 tokenId)



---

5. Blue-Chip (Non-custodial)

enrollBluechip()

harvestBluechip(address collection)



---

6. Governance

propose(uint8 pType, uint8 paramTarget, uint256 newValue, address collectionContext) returns (bytes32)

vote(bytes32 id)

executeProposal(bytes32 id)



---

7. Admin / Treasury

withdrawTreasury(address to, uint256 amount)



---

8. Views / Getters

stakingStats() returns (...)

pendingRewardsView(address collection, address owner, uint256 tokenId) returns (uint256)

treasuryBalance() returns (uint256)

deployerAddress() returns (address)

paused() returns (bool)

‚úÖ That‚Äôs the full surface API for your contract.

üîπ DApp Wiring (Category ‚Üí Tab)

In the full DApp code I gave you (the long expanded v1 layout + v6 UX), here‚Äôs how these map:

Stake Tab

stake, batchStake, harvest, unstake

registerCollection

approve721 (ERC721 helper)

pendingRewardsView (add optional UI panel)


Blue-Chip Tab

enrollBluechip

harvestBluechip

setBluechipCollection


Governance Tab

propose

vote

executeProposal


Guardians Tab

proposeDeployerRecovery, approveDeployerRecovery, executeDeployerRecovery

proposeAdminRecovery, approveAdminRecovery, executeAdminRecovery

setDeployerGuardian, setAdminGuardian (could add under advanced section)


Admin Tab

pause, unpause

withdrawTreasury


Stats Panel

stakingStats

treasuryBalance

deployerAddress

paused

(optional: burnedCatalystByAddress, lastStakingBlock, etc. if you want)




---

üîπ Next Step

I can update the full DApp code to include every function above, with clear grouping:

Add missing setDeployerGuardian / setAdminGuardian under Guardians ‚Üí ‚ÄúCouncil Management‚Äù

Add pendingRewardsView read-only box under Stake

Ensure all views (treasuryBalance, deployerAddress, paused, etc.) show in the live Stats panel

Keep provider for reads / signer for writes
