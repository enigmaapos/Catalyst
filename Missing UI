üß† Why This Matters

High priority items are whitepaper promises: governance transparency, guardian recoverability, stake visibility.

Medium priority improves user trust and analytics ‚Äî helps community see sustainability in action.

Low priority is about future-proofing and nice-to-have technical transparency.
