üß† Why This Matters

High priority items are whitepaper promises: governance transparency, guardian recoverability, stake visibility.

Medium priority improves user trust and analytics ‚Äî helps community see sustainability in action.

Low priority is about future-proofing and nice-to-have technical transparency.




üîë Recommended Placement

1Ô∏è‚É£ Guardian Council Dashboard

Location:
/pages/guardian.tsx (new Next.js page or a dedicated tab inside your existing /pages/admin.tsx if you have an admin/guardian section).

Why here:

It pulls gu.deployerCouncil.guardians[], gu.adminCouncil.guardians[], and GuardianLib.RecoveryProposal data (read-only views).

This is an administrative function, so isolating it in its own route or tab keeps it clean.


How to mount:

Wrap your HTML snippet inside a React component (e.g., <GuardianCouncil />) and import it in guardian.tsx.

Hook Approve / Reject / Execute buttons to your write functions:

await contract.approveDeployerRecovery();  
await contract.executeDeployerRecovery();



---

2Ô∏è‚É£ User Portfolio Table

Location:
Inside Stake Tab of your existing user dashboard ‚Äî likely /pages/stake.tsx or /components/StakeDashboard.tsx.

Suggested spot:
Directly below your stake form or current position summary, so the user immediately sees all active stakes.

Hooking logic:

Read: s.stakePortfolioByUser[collection][address]

Loop over tokenIds ‚Üí call s.stakeLog[collection][tokenId]

Populate remaining term, last harvest block, pending rewards.

Wire Harvest All button ‚Üí batch calls to harvestNFT().

Wire Unstake ‚Üí call unstakeNFT(collection, tokenId).



---

3Ô∏è‚É£ Governance Proposal Cards

Location:
Inside Governance Tab or /pages/governance.tsx.

Suggested placement:
Just under your proposal creation form (or in a separate section with filters).

Hooks:

Read: g.proposals[i] in a loop, compute votes ‚Üí proposal.votesCast / proposal.minVotesRequiredScaled.

Use votingDurationBlocks to compute Ends in X days.

Buttons ‚Üí vote(proposalId, support) and executeProposal(proposalId).



---

4Ô∏è‚É£ Treasury Analytics

Location:
Inside Admin Tab or /pages/treasury.tsx.

Mount chart component here and feed it off-chain indexed events (TreasuryDeposit, TreasuryWithdrawal).

This section is for protocol maintainers, not users ‚Äî so hide behind an admin route or a special dashboard tab.



---

5Ô∏è‚É£ Per-Collection Stats + Blue-Chip Insights

Location:
Inside /pages/collections.tsx or as a tab in your dashboard UI.

Good for analytics view ‚Äî can be a grid view per collection.

For Blue-chip: read b.bluechipWallets[collection][wallet].



---

6Ô∏è‚É£ Tier Upgrade Proposal Support

Location:
Same Governance Tab where users create proposals.

Add a dropdown option for ProposalType.TIER_UPGRADE.

When executed ‚Üí call setBluechipCollection(collection) (if contract hook is implemented).



---

7Ô∏è‚É£ Contract Version & Proxy Info

Location:
Footer Component ‚Äî used sitewide.

Place at bottom of your _app.tsx layout or shared Footer.tsx.

Read proxy + implementation address (UUPSUpgradeable).

Optionally resolve implementation address via Etherscan API.



---

‚úÖ TL;DR Placement Table

Section	Recommended File / Tab	Why

Guardian Council	/pages/guardian.tsx (or Admin tab)	Council quorum & recovery are admin-level features

Treasury Analytics	/pages/treasury.tsx	Protocol-wide financial view
Collection Stats	/pages/collections.tsx	Analytics & APR estimation
Blue-chip Insights	Same as collections or separate bluechip.tsx	Niche data view for power users
Tier Upgrade Proposal	Governance Tab	A type of governance action
Contract Version	Shared Footer.tsx	Always visible, good for debugging
