Missing pieces (but planned to add):

1. Fee logic (90% burn / 9% treasury / 1% deployer)
→ needs a FeeManagerLib or direct handling in harvest/unstake/registration.


2. Blue-chip wallet registration (non-custodial)
→ instead of staking, register wallet for permanent earnings.


3. Unverified/junk NFTs staking + proof-of-burn logic.


4. Governance integrations
→ adjust reward rates, fees, stake limits, etc.


5. Treasury bonus flows (Top 1% burner bonus).


6. More safety hooks (pausable, emergency stops).
